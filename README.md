# TopDownShooter
Top down shooter made in Unity 5.5

A fan made game inspired by a Japanese puzzle-RPG game - Puzzle and Dragons - where you defend yourself from a wave of infinitely spawned monsters in a top down shooter style twist to the match "3 orbs" game.

Controls:

Q: Activate temporary character buff

W: Move Up

A: Move Left

S: Move Down

D: Move Right

R: Reloads the current weapon

T: Toggles a flashlight

ESC: Pause Menu



All models haven't been made yet but there are currently 2 playable characters:

Bastet: Uses a shotgun, can temporarily increase the shotgun's spread and damage

Scheat: Uses a minigun, can two prong the barrage of bullets and increases damage



The  game's enemies retain the basic "lunge at player" attack. As of now, all enemies are tiered based on colors (weakest) red->blue->black (strongest). 

This project is still being developed but most of the basic features have been implemented.
